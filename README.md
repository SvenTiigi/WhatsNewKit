### Manual Presentation

If you wish to manually present a `WhatsNewView` you can make use of the `sheet(whatsNew:)` modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State
    var whatsNew: WhatsNew? = WhatsNew(
        title: "WhatsNewKit",
        features: [
            .init(
                image: .init(
                    systemName: "star.fill",
                    foregroundColor: .orange
                ),
                title: "Showcase your new App Features",
                subtitle: "Present your new app features..."
            ),
            // ...
        ]
    )
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            // ...
        }
        .sheet(
            whatsNew: self.$whatsNew
        )
    }
    
}
```

### Automatic Presentation

The automatic presentation mode allows you to simply declare your new features via the SwiftUI Environment and WhatsNewKit will take care to present the corresponding `WhatsNewView`.

First add a `.whatsNewSheet()` modifier to the view where the `WhatsNewView` should be presented on.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            // ...
        }
        // Automatically present a WhatsNewView, if needed.
        // The WhatsNew that should be presented to the user
        // is automatically retrieved from the `WhatsNewEnvironment`
        .whatsNewSheet()
    }

}
```

The `.whatsNewSheet()` modifier is making use of the `WhatsNewEnvironment` to retrieve an optional WhatsNew object that should be presented to the user for the current version. Therefore you can easily configure the `WhatsNewEnvironment` via the `environment` modifier.

```swift
extension App: SwiftUI.App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(
                    \.whatsNew, 
                    WhatsNewEnvironment(
                        // Specify in which way the presented WhatsNew Versions are stored.
                        // In default the `UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore` is used.
                        versionStore: UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore(),
                        // Pass a `WhatsNewCollectionProvider` or an array of WhatsNew instances
                        whatsNewCollection: self
                    )
                )
        }
    }

}

// MARK: - App+WhatsNewCollectionProvider

extension App: WhatsNewCollectionProvider {

    /// Declare your WhatsNew instances per version
    var whatsNewCollection: WhatsNewCollection {
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.0.0",
            // ...
        )
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.1.0",
            // ...
        )
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.2.0",
            // ...
        )
    }

}
```

## WhatsNewEnvironment

The `WhatsNewEnvironment` will take care to determine the matching WhatsNew object that should be presented to the user for the current version.

As seen in the previous example you can initialize a `WhatsNewEnvironment` by specifying the `WhatsNewVersionStore` and providing a `WhatsNewCollection`.

```swift
// Initialize WhatsNewEnvironment by passing an array of WhatsNew Instances.
// UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore is used as default WhatsNewVersionStore
let whatsNewEnvironment = WhatsNewEnvironment(
    whatsNewCollection: [
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.0.0",
            // ...
        )
    ]
)

// Initialize WhatsNewEnvironment with NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore
// which stores the presented versions in iCloud.
// WhatsNewCollection is provided by a `WhatsNewBuilder` closure
let whatsNewEnvironment = WhatsNewEnvironment(
    versionStore: NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore(),
    whatsNewCollection: {
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.0.0",
            // ...
        )
    }
)
```

Additionally, the `WhatsNewEnvironment` includes a fallback for patch versions. For example when a user installs version `1.0.1` and you only have declared a `WhatsNew` for version `1.0.0` the environment will automatically fallback to version `1.0.0` and present the `WhatsNewView` to the user if needed.

If you wish to further customize the behaviour of the `WhatsNewEnvironment` you can easily subclass it and override the `whatsNew()` function.

```swift
class MyCustomWhatsNewEnvironment: WhatsNewEnvironment {
    
    /// Retrieve a WhatsNew that should be presented to the user, if available.
    override func whatsNew() -> WhatsNew? {
        // The current version
        let currentVersion = self.currentVersion
        // Your declared WhatsNew objects
        let whatsNewCollection = self.whatsNewCollection
        // The WhatsNewVersionStore used to determine the already presented versions
        let versionStore = self.whatsNewVersionStore
        // TODO: Determine WhatsNew that should be presented to the user...
    }
    
}
```

## WhatsNewVersionStore

A `WhatsNewVersionStore` is a protocol type which is responsible for saving and retrieving versions that have been presented to the user.

```swift
let whatsNewVersionStore: WhatsNewVersionStore

// Save presented versions
whatsNewVersionStore.save(presentedVersion: "1.0.0")

// Retrieve presented versions
let presentedVersions = whatsNewVersionStore.presentedVersions

// Retrieve bool value if a given version has already been presented
let hasPresented = whatsNewVersionStore.hasPresented("1.0.0")
```

WhatsNewKit comes along with three predefined implementations:

```swift
// Persists presented versions in the UserDefaults
let userDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore = UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore()

// Persists presented versions in iCloud using the NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
let ubiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore = NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore()

// Stores presented versions in memory. Perfect for testing purposes
let inMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore = InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore()
```

If you already have a specific implementation to store user related settings like Realm or Core Data you can easily adopt your existing implementation to the `WhatsNewVersionStore` protocol.

### NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore

If you are making use of the `NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore` please ensure to enable the [iCloud Key-value storage](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/DesigningForKey-ValueDataIniCloud.html) capability in the "Signing & Capabilities" section of your Xcode project.

## WhatsNew

The following sections explains how a `WhatsNew` struct can be initialized in order to describe the new features for a given version of your app.

```swift
let whatsnew = WhatsNew(
    // The Version that relates to the features you want to showcase
    version: "1.0.0",
    // The title that is shown at the top
    title: "What's New",
    // The features you want to showcase
    features: [
        WhatsNew.Feature(
            image: .init(systemName: "star.fill"),
            title: "Title",
            subtitle: "Subtitle"
        )
    ],
    // The primary action that is used to dismiss the WhatsNewView
    primaryAction: WhatsNew.PrimaryAction(
        title: "Continue",
        backgroundColor: .accentColor,
        foregroundColor: .white,
        hapticFeedback: .notification(.success),
        onDismiss: {
            print("WhatsNewView has been dismissed")
        }
    ),
    // The optional secondary action that is displayed above the primary action
    secondaryAction: WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
        title: "Learn more",
        foregroundColor: .accentColor,
        hapticFeedback: .selection,
        action: .openURL(
            .init(string: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
        )
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.Version

The `WhatsNew.Version` specifies the version that has introduced certain features to your app.

```swift
// Initialize with major, minor, and patch
let version = WhatsNew.Version(
    major: 1, 
    minor: 0, 
    patch: 0
)

// Initialize by string literal
let version: WhatsNew.Version = "1.0.0"

// Initialize WhatsNew Version by using the current version of your bundle
let version: WhatsNew.Version = .current()
```

### WhatsNew.Title

A `WhatsNew.Title` represents the title text that is rendered above the features.

```swift
// Initialize by string literal
let title: WhatsNew.Title = "Continue"

// Initialize with text and foreground color
let title = WhatsNew.Title(
    text: "Continue",
    foregroundColor: .primary
)

// On >= iOS 15 initialize with AttributedString using Markdown
let title = WhatsNew.Title(
    text: try AttributedString(
        markdown: "What's **New**"
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.Feature

A `WhatsNew.Feature` describe a specific feature of your app and generally consist of an image, title, and subtitle.

```swift
let feature = WhatsNew.Feature(
    image: .init(
        systemName: "wand.and.stars"
    ),
    title: "New Design",
    subtitle: .init(
        try AttributedString(
            markdown: "An awesome new _Design_"
        )
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.PrimaryAction

The `WhatsNew.PrimaryAction` allows you to configure the behaviour of the primary button which is used to dismiss the presented `WhatsNewView`

```swift
let primaryAction = WhatsNew.PrimaryAction(
    title: "Continue",
    backgroundColor: .blue,
    foregroundColor: .white,
    hapticFeedback: .notification(.success),
    onDismiss: {
        print("WhatsNewView has been dismissed")
    }   
)
```
> Note: HapticFeedback will only be executed on iOS

### WhatsNew.SecondaryAction

A `WhatsNew.SecondaryAction` which is displayed above the `WhatsNew.PrimaryAction` can be optionally supplied when initializing a `WhatsNew` instance and allows you to present an additional View, perform a custom action or open an URL.

```swift
// SecondaryAction that presents a View
let secondaryActionPresentAboutView = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Learn more",
    foregroundColor: .blue,
    hapticFeedback: .selection,
    action: .present {
        AboutView()
    }  
)

// SecondaryAction that opens a URL
let secondaryActionOpenURL = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Read more",
    foregroundColor: .blue,
    hapticFeedback: .selection,
    action: .open(
        url: .init(string: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
    )  
)

// SecondaryAction with custom execution
let secondaryActionCustom = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Custom",
    action: .custom { presentationMode in
        // ...
    }
)
```
> Note: HapticFeedback will only be executed on iOS

## Decoding WhatsNew

WhatsNew can also be decoded from JSON or other decodable file types. 

Images, PrimaryActions and SecondaryActions are provided to the decoder via `userInfo` and are referenced by string keys:

```
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.userInfo["star.fill"] = WhatsNew.Feature.Image(systemName: "star.fill")
decoder.userInfo["continue"] = WhatsNew.PrimaryAction(
    title: "Continue",
    backgroundColor: .accentColor,
    foregroundColor: .white,
    hapticFeedback: .notification(.success),
    onDismiss: {
        print("WhatsNewView has been dismissed")
    }
)
decoder.userInfo["learnMore"] = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Learn more",
    foregroundColor: .accentColor,
    hapticFeedback: .selection,
    action: .openURL(
        .init(string: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
    )
) 
```

A JSON file ist structured like this:

```
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "title": "What's New",
    "features": [
        {
            "image": "star.fill",
            "title": "Title",
            "subtitle": "Subtitle"
        }
    ],
    "primaryAction": "continue",
    "secondaryAction": "learnMore"
}
```

## Layout

WhatsNewKit allows you to adjust the layout of a presented `WhatsNewView` in various ways.

The most simple way is by mutating the `WhatsNew.Layout.default` instance.

```swift
WhatsNew.Layout.default.featureListSpacing = 35
```

When using the automatic presentation style you can supply a default layout when initializing the WhatsNewEnvironment.

```swift
.environment(
    \.whatsNew,
    .init(
        defaultLayout: WhatsNew.Layout(
            showsScrollViewIndicators: true,
            featureListSpacing: 35
        ),
        whatsNew: self
    )
)
```

Alternatively you can pass a `WhatsNew.Layout` when automatically or manually presenting the WhatsNewView

```swift
.whatsNewSheet(
    layout: WhatsNew.Layout(
        contentPadding: .init(
            top: 80, 
            leading: 0,
            bottom: 0,
            trailing: 0
        )
    )
)
```

```swift
.sheet(
    whatsNew: self.$whatsNew,
    layout: WhatsNew.Layout(
        footerActionSpacing: 20
    )
)
```

## WhatsNewViewController

When using `UIKit` or `AppKit` you can make use of the `WhatsNewViewController`.

```swift
let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: WhatsNew(
        version: "1.0.0",
        // ...
    ),
    layout: WhatsNew.Layout(
        contentSpacing: 80
    )
)
```

If you wish to present a `WhatsNewViewController` only if the version of the WhatsNew instance has not been presented you can make use of the convenience failable initializer.

```swift
// Verify WhatsNewViewController is available for presentation
guard let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: WhatsNew(
        version: "1.0.0",
        // ...
    ),
    versionStore: UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore()
) else {
    // Version of WhatsNew has already been presented
    return
}

// Present WhatsNewViewController
// Version will be automatically saved in the provided
// WhatsNewVersionStore when the WhatsNewViewController gets dismissed
self.present(whatsNewViewController, animated: true)
```
